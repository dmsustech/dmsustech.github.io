In this talk, I will present the complete classification of triply-transitive strongly regular graphs. This work concludes a program initiated by Herman, Maleki, and Razafimahatratra, who resolved most cases but left open the status of two infinite families from finite geometry. We prove that these remaining families are indeed triply-transitive, thereby settling the classificaition. This is joint work with Hanlin Zou.

An invariant for cospectral graphs is a property shared by all graphs. In this
talk, we give three new invariants for cospectral graphs, characterized by
their arithmetic nature. Based on these, we are able to show that under certain
conditions, every graph cospectral with a graph $G$ is determined by its
generalized spectrum. This is a joint work with Yizhe Ji, Quanyu Tang and Hao
Zhang.

Halpern-Läuchli Theorem (HL) is one instance of Ram-seyan theorems, with deep connections to mathematical logic. In this talk, I will report some recent results related to HL, jointly obtained with Chitat Chong and Wei Li from National University of Singapore. I will also spend some time introducing Reverse Mathematics to the general audience, including some history, main motivation and basic terminologies.

 I will speak about the recent progress on the Erdos-Ko-Rado type results for different structures that we have managed to obtain using the method of spread approximations. I'll mostly focus on partitions and, in particular, the resolution of the Meagher-Moura question on partially t-intersecting families of partitions.

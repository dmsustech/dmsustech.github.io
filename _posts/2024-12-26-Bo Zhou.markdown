Spectral graph theory  deals with the study of the graph properties by using linear algebra tools and techniques via an associated marix for a graph. The most frequently used are  the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian, the signless Laplacian, and the distance matrix.  We discuss some recent works on the \alpha-spectral radius, the Laplacian eigenvalue distribution and the second largest distance eigenvalue.

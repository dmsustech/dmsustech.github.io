In 2007, Bollob´as and Nikiforov proposed the following conjecture that for
any non-complete graph G on v1, . . . , vn vertices with m edges and the clique
number ω, the following inequality holds:
λ

1 + λ

2 ≤

1 −

2m,
where λ1 and λ2 are the two largest eigenvalues of the n × n adjacency matrix
A (G) = (aij ) with aij = 1 if and only if vi
is adjacent to vj
. In this talk,
we introduce some recent results and new methods. In particular, we prove
that the conjecture holds for both line graphs and graphs with at most

triangles, which extends and strengthens some known results.

We will discuss the axiomatic foundations of geometry and its applications to time travel.
Our main focus will be on hyperovals in the projective plane $$PG(2, 2^h)$$. The talk
will avoid complicated expressions such as 

<div align="center">
$$\int \frac{x \sin(x)}{1 + \cos(x)^2} \mathrm{d}x$$
</div>

and other monstrosities.

Let $n$ and $k$ be two positive integers satisfying $n\geq 2k$. Let ${\mathcal A}$ be an intersecting family of $\binom{[n]}{k}$. The Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem states that $$|{\mathcal A}| \leq {n-1 \choose k - 1}.$$ There are many generalizations of this theorem and  many ways to study it have been generated as well. The generating set method, which has so far  not received much attention, is a very efficient way of them.  In this talk, we will introduces this method and give some of its applications.

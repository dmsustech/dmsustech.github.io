For a sequence S = (s1,...,sk) of non-decreasing positive integers, a
 packing S-coloring of a graph G is a partition of its vertex set V (G) into
 V1,...,Vk such that for every pair of distinct vertices u,v ∈ Vi the distance
 between u and v is at least si +1, where 1 ≤ i ≤ k. The packing chromatic
 number, χp(G), of a graph G is defined to be the smallest integer k such that
 G has a packing (1,2,...,k)-coloring. Gastineau and Togni asked an open
 question “Is it true that the 1-subdivision (D(G)) of any subcubic graph G
 has packing chromatic number at most 5?” and later Breˇ sar, Klavˇ zar, Rall,
 and Wash conjectured that it is true. Furthermore, Gastineau and Togni
 also asked “Is it true that every subcubic graph except the Petersen graph
 is packing (1,2,2,2,2,2)-colorable?”.
 In this talk, we will discuss some recent developments on above-mentioned
 problems

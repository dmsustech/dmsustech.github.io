A linear forest is a graph whose components are paths. The linear arboricity la(F) of a graph F is the minimum number of linear forests required to decompose its edges. Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary (1980) proposed the Linear Arboricity Conjecture that la(G)≤ ⌈(d+1)/2 ⌉ for any graph G of maximum degree d. The current best bound, due to Lang and Postle (2023), establishes la(G)≤d/2+ 3√d  log^4  d for sufficiently large d. And they proved this in the stronger list setting proposed by An and Wu (1999).

We extend Lang and Postle's result to digraphs in the stronger degree-f setting with matching error term. Given a digraph D and a function f on its vertices, a directed subgraph of D is a degree-f branching if every vertex v have indegree at most 1, outdegree at most f(v) - 1 and its underlying undirected graph is a forest. The directed degree-f arboricity a_f (D) of D is the minimum number of colours required to colour the arcs of D so that every color class is a degree-f branching. Let Δ_f (D) be the maximum of d^- (v),d^+ (v)/(f(v)-1). We show that any digraph D with d=Δ_f (D) sufficiently large and f=o(log^(1/2) d) admits a decomposition into at most d+ 3√d  log^4  d degree-f branchings. This improves a result of Wdowinski. Moreover, we establish this bound in the stronger list coloring setting.

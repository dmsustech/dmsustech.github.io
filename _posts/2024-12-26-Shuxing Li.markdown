 An (mn)-generalized bent function is a function from Zn
 2 to Zm so that its
 associated Fourier transformations have constant absolute value. It is known
 that an (mn)-generalized bent function exists whenever one of the following
 holds:
 (1) both m and n are even.
 (2) 4 m.
 On the other hand, all known results suggest that for (mn) pair that fails
 to satisfy both of the above conditions, (mn)-generalized bent function does
 not exist. In this talk, we will discuss the recent nonexistence result of (m4)
generalized bent functions with m being odd. This result crucially relies on
 analyzing vanishing sums of complex roots of unity.
 This is joint work with Ka Hin Leung (National University of Singapore)
 and Songtao Mao (Johns Hopkins University).

Finite generalized quadrangles are finite point-line incidence geometries whose bipartite incidence graphs have diameter 4 and girth 8. Their automorphism groups are strongly linked to the finite simple groups of Lie type. In this talk, I will report recent results on classifying primitive flag-transitive generalized quadrangles.
